# 🌍 Global Happiness & CO₂ Emissions Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project delves into the **interconnection between economic development, CO₂ emissions, and global happiness**. Using **Power BI**, we analyze patterns and relationships that highlight how industrial advancements have influenced environmental sustainability and human well-being over time.

## 📊 Datasets Used
1. **OWID CO₂ Data (Cleaned)** – A structured dataset tracking global CO₂ emissions by country, sector, and energy source.
2. **World Happiness Report (WHR 2023)** – Contains happiness scores, economic indicators, and social well-being metrics across nations.
3. **Annual CO₂ Emissions by Country** – Captures yearly CO₂ emissions trends worldwide, helping to assess long-term environmental changes.

## 🌎 Storytelling Through Data
### 🔥 The Rise of CO₂ Emissions
From **1950 onwards, CO₂ emissions skyrocketed**, signaling the rapid industrialization of economies. While this growth fueled economic expansion, it also raised concerns about climate change and sustainability.

### 💰 The Wealth-Emissions Paradox
High-income nations and fast-growing economies, especially in **Asia and developed regions**, emerged as the largest contributors to CO₂ emissions. Countries like **China and Bahrain** showcase a strong correlation between GDP growth and increased emissions, highlighting the economic-environmental tradeoff.

### ⚡ Energy Sources & Their Impact
The dominance of fossil fuels in global energy consumption is evident, with **coal contributing nearly half (48.64%) of global emissions**, followed by **oil (35.09%) and gas (16.27%)**. This underscores the urgent need for cleaner energy alternatives.

### 😀 The Pursuit of Happiness in a Polluted World
The analysis reveals that **China consistently ranks high in both happiness and emissions**, suggesting that economic progress can enhance well-being. However, nations like **Malawi and Malta** exhibit the negative impact of CO₂ emissions on happiness, proving that pollution and environmental degradation can diminish life satisfaction.

### 📉 The Social & Governance Effect
Beyond GDP and emissions, happiness is significantly influenced by **health life expectancy, social support, and corruption perception**. Countries with strong social systems tend to maintain higher happiness scores, regardless of their economic standing.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** for interactive data visualization and analysis.
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** for data preprocessing and cleansing.
- **Data storytelling techniques** to drive actionable insights.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Expand analysis to **predict CO₂ impact on happiness trends** using machine learning models.
- Develop a **real-time Power BI dashboard** for tracking global CO₂ and well-being indicators.
- Include **renewable energy adoption trends** to assess sustainability progress.

## 📢 Conclusion
This project reveals the **complex tradeoffs between industrial growth, environmental impact, and human happiness**. While **economic progress can boost well-being, unchecked CO₂ emissions pose long-term risks to sustainability and quality of life**. A balanced approach, integrating **clean energy, social development, and environmental consciousness**, is essential for a happier and healthier future.

🌟 **Let’s create a world where both prosperity and sustainability thrive!** 🌟
